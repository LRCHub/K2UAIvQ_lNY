Green hickorywood will make your fireplace hot
You try to explain to a Berkeley cop
He choked with with my peats and shot me down for pot
I said, man I'm clean, I'm just about to blow my top
They finally took me in for possession of...
Love and my pocket knife
But I swear to God I was only high on life
High on livin', high on lovin'
High on livin', high on lovin,' and lovin' and forgivin'
I have no suit lapel in which to hold my flower
I said Lord, that's okay man
It's just the lateness of the hour
Well I be clean when heaven lets if shower
They finally took me in for possession of...
Love and my pocket knife
But I swear to God I was only high on life
High on livin', high on lovin'
High on livin', high on lovin,' and lovin' and forgivin'
High on livin', high on lovin'
High on livin', high on lovin,' and lovin' and forgivin'
High on livin', high on lovin'
High on livin', high on lovin,' and lovin' and forgivin'
